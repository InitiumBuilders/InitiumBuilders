- 👋 Hi, I’m @InitiumBuilders {{{ August
- 👀 I’m interested in building products, teams, and communities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to Vibe Code
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my latest project Initium.Builders
- 📫 How to reach me August@Unitium.One
- 😄 Mantra: Build Community.
- Latest idea I'm exploring: Emergent Citizenship
- ⚡ Fun fact: I think the best way to help someone is to either teach them how to play an instrument or to teach them how to code.
